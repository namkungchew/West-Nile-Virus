semblance of the cost and benefits of spraying, we first need to estimate the cost of West Nile Virus. [A paper](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140210184713.htm) released by the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene studied the the economic impact of West Nile virus in the United States across the span of 13 years from 1999 to 2012.\n","\n","The 37,088 WNV disease cases reported to CDC from 1999 through 2012 included more than 16,000 patients with neurologic disease, over 18,000 patients who required hospitalization, and over 1,500 deaths. According to the CDC, individuals over 50 years of age are more likely to develop severe neurologic disease if infected. The total cost estimated was cumulative $778 million in health care expenditures and lost productivity.\n","\n","This gives us an average cost of approximately $21,000 per case reported.\n","\n","A [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7241786/) published on the US National Library of Medicine stated 66 human cases of WNV for Chicago, Illinois in 2013. This brings the total cost to approximately $1,386,000.\n","\n","The cost for spraying itself is not specified anywhere, however, the [2013 Chicago government budget](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/obm/supp_info/2013%20Budget/2013Overview.pdf) listed the budget allocated to Environmental Health to be $1,191,811. This is defined as performing routine and complaint-generated inspections of facilities to ensure the City's ordinances related to environmental hazards are enforced. Coordinates mosquito surveillance and control activities and provides public education to reduce the risk of vector-borne diseases, principally the West Nile virus.\n","\n","It is hard to do a dollar to dollar comparison of the cost/ benefit of spraying but we can construct a simple equation to estimate this.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"id":"22fdc9b5"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"84e8c1a0"},"source":["![image.png](attachment:image.png)"],"id":"84e8c1a0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3f37d06f"},"source":["We propose a simple equation above as a guide to estimate the cost/ benefits of spraying.

They can educate the public on preventing stagnant water, applying insect repellent, wearing the proper attire to reduce the chances of getting bitten by mosquitos.\n","\n","Other measures which they have already undertaken but can place more emphasis on is the reporting of dead birds (a key in transmission of WNV), reporting on tall grass and weeds."],"id":"5530a15b"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"418fdfa9"},"source":[""],"id":"418fdfa9","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
